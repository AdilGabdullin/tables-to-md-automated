| Adjusted meeting hours       | An adjustment is applied so that overlapping time is not double-counted when a person has overlapping meeting hours.  For example: A person with non-declined meeting requests from 2:00 -3:00 PM and 2:30 - 3:30 PM would yield 1.5 adjusted meeting hour.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Attended                     | A person is counted as attended for a meeting if they either accepted or did not respond to a meeting request (also referred to as non-declined meeting request).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Attendee                     | A person who was invited and attended the meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Attributes                   | A defined characteristic about the person, such as team, department, or function.

| Calendar fragmentation       | When a person does not have blocks of time sufficient to focus on completing complex tasks. This is typified by having only small blocks of time (15, 30, 60 minutes) between meetings. Anything that is not focus time (uninterrupted time blocks of two hours or more with no meetings) is considered calendar fragmentation.                                                                                             |
