Definition
Adjusted meeting hours
An adjustment is applied so that overlapping time is not double-counted when a person has overlapping meeting hours.  For example: A person with non-declined meeting requests from 2:00 -3:00 PM and 2:30 - 3:30 PM would yield 1.5 adjusted meeting hour.
Attended
A person is counted as attended for a meeting if they either accepted or did not respond to a meeting request (also referred to as non-declined meeting request).
Attendee
A person who was invited and attended the meeting.
Attributes
A defined characteristic about the person, such as team, department, or function. Required attributes are the subset of attributes that are required in order to calculate metrics.
Calendar fragmentation
When a person does not have blocks of time sufficient to focus on completing complex tasks. This is typified by having only small blocks of time (15, 30, 60 minutes) between meetings. Anything that is not focus time (uninterrupted time blocks of two hours or more with no meetings) is considered calendar fragmentation.

Custom attribute
Organizational data attributes that describe the people being analyzed. If supplied by the company, these attributes can be used in grouping of data, and to filter reports and customize metrics. However, they are not reserved for metrics calculations.
Focus time

Optional attribute

The optional attributes are FunctionType, Layer, HourlyRate.
Organization
A required attribute that describes the organizational unit in which the employee resides. The exact value will be determined by the company’s structure, as well as how that structure is captured in within the company’s human resources information system. For example: the organization may also be known as department, function, or could be defined by a specific manager name in the management hierarchy. 
Organizational data
Attributes about people in the organization or people who collaborate with the organization that Workplace Analytics analyzes. Most organizational data are obtained from a company’s human resources information system.

Redundant
A meeting is considered redundant if at least three attendees are from different levels within the same organization. For example: A meeting whose attendees included a General Manager, a Director and an Independent Contributor from the same organization would be considered redundant.
